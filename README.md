This project aims to simulate a communication system that includes signal transmission
through different types of channels. The original audio signal is first processed through one
of several predefined channels, such as delta, exponential decay, sinc, or custom. Noise is
then added to the channel output to simulate real-world interference. An ideal low-pass filter
is finally applied at the receiver to retrieve the original signal. The project is implemented
using MATLAB GUI to allow interactive selection of the channel type and noise level, and to
visualize the signal in both time and frequency domains
